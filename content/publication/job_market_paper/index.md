abstract: This paper examines the impact of decentralizing vehicle registration fees in Mexico, analyzing the resulting tax avoidance and price response behaviors and their effects on vehicle fleet composition and environmental outcomes. By using a differences in difference with a synthetic control across price bins before and after the policy change, we create a counterfactual distribution that allows us to see that decentralization led to tax avoidance and the tax schedule lead to increased purchases of cheaper cars that are more fuel efficient but worse at the tail pipe.The analysis further explores the implications of these changes by modeling the individuals response to the tax and studying different counterfactual scenarios such a improving compliance or changing the tax schedule finding that avoidance mitigates the distortionary effects of the tax.

summary: This paper analyzes the impact of decentralizing vehicle registration fees in Mexico, highlighting increased tax avoidance and a shift toward cheaper, fuel-efficient but higher-emission cars. Using a differences-in-differences approach with synthetic controls, it models individual tax responses and explores scenarios, finding that tax avoidance mitigates the tax's distortionary effects.

  alt_text: Vehicle registrations per $10,000 price bin for the states of Morelos, Mexico, and Mexico City. The red dotted line represents the exemption threshold price in Mexico City, while the blue dotted line represents the threshold for the state of Mexico. The figure illustrates missing registrations to the right of the exemption threshold of each state. For the state of Morelos, higher registration values are observed for the most expensive vehicles, suggesting a potential avoidance of the registration fee.
